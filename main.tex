\maketitle

\section{Project Selection}
For the project selection each of us proposed some University projects we made in the previous semester whose design required a refactor. We ended up selecting Mattia's project called "Sorting Algorithms Visualized Through Images"(SAVTI), because it will be used as starting point of his BSc thesis(he is an Erasmus student) and a deep refactoring is needed to make his life easier since as it is today the project presents some design anti-pattern that must be removed.

\section{Project Description}

\section{Refactoring Goals}
The refactoring we made had two main goals. The first one is to remove code smells inside the code, for this purpose we used SonarQube to detect part of the code whose design could be imporved. 
(\textcolor{red}{addActionListeners in MainWindow and AdvancedSettings})\\
The second one is to make the code more readable since the project presents complexity flaws in some classes which have very long methods.
