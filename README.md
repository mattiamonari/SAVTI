# Sorting Algorithm Visualized Through Images (SAVTI)

SAVTI is a desktop application created for scholastic purpose for the [OOP course from the Universit√† degli Studi di Modena e Reggio Emilia](https://github.com/nbicocchi/ooprogramming). 
It gives the possibility to randomize an image with a custom precision (which gets splitted in an array of tiles), choose a custom sorting algorithm and reorder it.
This process will be encoded in a .mp4 video thanks to the [jcodec](https://github.com/jcodec/jcodec) library, obtaining results similar to [this](https://youtu.be/4lyLJmZbQSA).
